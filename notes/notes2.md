- compile connected_home_over_ip ( example, chip )
- https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples
- https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/all-clusters-app/linux

- compile the example
- study the core dependencies of the matter(chip) and stdk
- study the built system of the stdk and matter
- study the build logs of both stdk and chip
- identify the files getting compiled and identify the flags and macros
  are getting enabled for files
- take matter code and put it in stdk directory
- write build script to compile matter within stdk

assignment:
- compare different matter stack after studying the matter specification
  - memory requirement/footprint (both ram and rom memory), 
    - cpu requirement
  - on which OS the stack can run
  - internal:
  	- roles, procedures defined by the matter sepcification
- prepare a report on the feature supported by the different matter
  stack, (table, in summary)
